    <p>What if I told you that mozzarella sticks never had to end? That for $10, you could eat for free (for $10) for the rest of your natural life? That there exists a spot in the space-time continuum in which it is always Friday? That there are free refills on all Slushes&trade; excluding Red Bull&reg; branded items?</p>

    <p>Last Monday TGI Friday's unveiled a new promotion (available at many TGI Friday's locations, but none on the island of Manhattan) whereby customers can gorge themselves on unlimited appetizers &ndash; without fear of punishment, embarrassment, or ostracization &ndash; for a one-time payment of $10. The promotion is called "Endless Appetizers."</p>

    <p>The day after "Endless Appetizers" was announced, I went to TGI Friday's in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay. I wanted to challenge the hubris of a company co-opting the infinite for a marketing gimmick. I wanted to demand accountability from copywriters.</p> 

    <p>I wanted to call their bluff and eat appetizers until they kicked me out, to seek the limit of this supposedly limitless publicity stunt.</p>

    <p>I soon learned the limit does not exist.</p>

    <h2>Prelude: The King's Gambit</h2>
    <p>In preparation for the depravity to come, I fast the night before, eating a only light meal of a bacon cheeseburger, four chicken McNuggets, and a small fries at midnight.</p>

    <p>Ten hours later, my editor, Max Read, messages me to outline the conditions this exercise must meet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I will not take advantage of the TGI Friday's wifi, read a book, or go to sleep.</li>
        <li>I will stay at least six hours past the restaurant's 11 a.m. opening time.</li>
        <li>I will consume mozzarella sticks with the voraciousness of bacteria feasting on the muscle tissue of a corpse. (This is not so much a condition as a given.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>He then proposes a bonus:</p>

    <blockquote>If you can stay till 1 a.m. I'll give you a week off.</blockquote>

    <p>In a separate conversation, my colleague Taylor offers to pay me $3 for every mozzarella stick I eat past the first 30.</p>

    <p>The offer before me is now one week's vacation and theoretically infinite profit.</p>

    <h2>Plate One: The King's Gambit Accepted</h2>
    <p>Due to traffic, I arrive at the Sheepshead Bay TGI Friday's about 20 minutes after its 11:00 a.m. opening.</p>

    <p>Figuring that honesty is the best policy, and that, at some point, it will become extremely difficult to conceal from the waitstaff the fact I have been sitting in the restaurant for 14 hours slowly eating mozzarella sticks, I decide beforehand that I will be up front with the TGI Friday's employees about the nature of my undertaking, including potential rewards.</p>

    <p>My waitress is a young woman named Gabby, who has straight black bangs and a long, low ponytail. Gabby tells me she has been off for a few days, and has only just heard the gospel of the TGI Friday's Endless Apps deal herself. I ask her if I can take advantage of the deal right then at that moment, and she reads aloud from a list of eligible items penciled on her order pad in round, swooping letters. I tell her I would like to order the unlimited mozzarella sticks. She tells me that, according to the restrictions of the promotion, I will only be permitted to receive unlimited quantities of one item, for example: barbecue boneless buffalo wings. I tell her I would like to order the unlimited mozzarella sticks.</p>

    </div>

    <p><strong>11:34 a.m.</strong> My first plate arrives. The mozzarella sticks are golden, dense, and huge. Each one is greater than the width of two of my index fingers. As a frequent and enthusiastic consumer of mozzarella sticks, I estimate that these are about twice the standard size. They are softly cuboid, not cylindrical, for reasons I assume are obscure and related to the maximally efficient, foolproof method by which they are packaged, shipped, and cooked. They arrive in herds of six, lightly dusted with shavings of "Parmesan" and "Romano" and flakes of parsley. (Over the course of several orders, this coating will become increasingly patchy, as TGI Friday's and I stop standing on formality.) An order normally costs $7.50, which means I will have to eat at least two in order for TGI Friday's Endless Apps to qualify as a "good deal." Each plate of six contains 1,100 calories.</p>

    <p>They taste like goddamn garbage.</p>

    <p>I would prefer to stop eating after the first one. I seriously regret not getting the potato skins, which appear on the menu alongside the word "FAV" printed inside a white circle with scalloped edges. A key at the bottom of the appetizer page explains that the presence of this symbol indicates the potato skins are a "House Favorite." The spot next to the mozzarella sticks listing that could conceivably be occupied by a "FAV" badge is vacant.</p>

    <p>I do not blame the waitstaff of TGI Friday's for the taste of the mozzarella sticks, which, for the entire length of my stay, will be marched to my booth piping hot and accompanied by an inch-deep cup (two, if I so request) of marinara sauce, as advertised.</p>

    <p>Nor do I blame the kitchen staff that cooks the mozzarella sticks to what must be called, thanks to their menacing consistency across the span of the day, a kind of perfection, every time.</p>

    <p>I blame the TGI Friday's test kitchen executive chef (a prepaid cellphone that Guy Fieri texts recipes to while high on whippets) for making the prototype of these sticks accidentally one full moon &ndash; for by accident is the only way such an item could ever have been deemed suitable for human consumption &ndash; and then never copping to the mistake.</p>

    <p><strong>12:00 p.m.</strong> I order my second plate.</p>

    <h2>Plate Two: The Bishop's Gambit</h2>

    <div class="image-wrapper left">

        <p class="caption">The disappointing ketchup bottle.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>12:15 p.m.</strong> I have now, having agreed to pay $10 for what is ostensibly $15 worth of mozzarella sticks, gotten "a good deal." "UP FOR A GAME?" reads the label of the Heinz ketchup EZ squeeze bottle on my table. No thanks, I'm busy. Just kidding &ndash; I'll be here for 13 more hours. I turn the bottle over &ndash; Let the games begin! &ndash; and am disappointed to discover that the game in question will be played on my phone rather than the ketchup bottle itself, and that I have to download a free QR code reader app to access it. For what will probably not be the last time in my life, I follow the instructions on the back of my ketchup bottle to the letter. The app begins downloading. I'll come back to it.</p>

    <p><strong>12:38 p.m.</strong> So far today, the music volume inside TGI Friday's has fallen just short of deafening. My booth is situated almost directly underneath a Bose speaker, and I consider asking for a trade until I realize the room was designed by M. C. Escher, and there are no tables not under speakers.</p>

    <p>A young woman under a speaker at a round table next to me places her hand on the shoulder of another woman, who could be her grandmother, and frowns as she talks. The older woman frowns too. They are both wearing printed jumpsuits (non-matching).</p>

    <p><strong>12:40 p.m.</strong> The app has finished downloading. For what will probably not be the last time in my life, I scan the QR code on the back of my ketchup bottle. The homepage of a tastefully ketchup-themed Trivial Pursuit™ mobile game springs to life on my iPhone. Underneath the Trivial Pursuit™ logo is a cartoon rendering of an apple with leaves that is most likely meant to represent a tomato except that it looks exactly like an apple with leaves. The homepage invites me to "Pour on the FUN," like it is ketchup. A small text disclaimer reveals that if I "play at least 3 rounds" I will be "eligible to receive a reward." The potential rewards keep piling up for me today.</p>

    <p><strong>12:41 p.m.</strong> Because in my regular life beyond the walls of this TGI Friday's I am more concerned with science and the secrets of philosophy than trivial pursuits, I don't do so hot. I correctly identify "What rhymes with hug me?" as a line from the 2013 single "Blurred Lines," but I have no idea what number Thomas Kinkade frequently incorporated into his paintings (5282).</p>

    <p><strong>12:47 p.m.</strong> Three rounds later, the "reward" is a coupon for ketchup which, in retrospect, makes sense. I should have realized.</p>

    <p><strong>12:58 p.m.</strong> I peel all the breading off a mozzarella stick.</p>

    <p>The main dining room of the Sheepshead Bay TGI Friday's looks out over the Plumb Beach Channel, which flows into Rockaway Inlet, and, beyond that, into the Atlantic Ocean. Although it represents a relatively minor portion of Earth's hydrosphere, the water of the channel laps pleasantly at the boats tied to its dock and reflects the sun's light in sparkling waves. It is as nice as any scenic bay or rainbow gasoline puddle.</p>

    <p>The charm of the spot is undercut by its precariousness. In November 2012, Hurricane Sandy filled the dining room with three feet of water; the restaurant only just reopened after being closed for over a year for repairs.</p>

    <p>It is a stone's throw away from the Coney Island Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>

    <p><strong>1:08 p.m.</strong> I keep discovering more mushed up pieces of breading and cheese slowly becoming coated in saliva under my tongue, which reminds me of the time I tried "oil pulling" for 30 seconds, at the direction of a friend.</p>

    <p><strong>1:14 p.m.</strong> A new waitress in my section is being trained by a more senior member of the waitstaff. "When you drop off food, it's protein first," her instructor explains to her, as they drop off two plates of food to the jump-suited women, protein first.</p>

    <p><strong>1:21 p.m.</strong> Without being asked, Gabby slides a glass of water to me, like she's handing off a cup to a marathoner.</p>

    <p><strong>1:30 p.m.</strong> I goddamn hate these fucking mozzarella sticks. The more of them I eat, the more I feel like I can taste every ingredient. Ingredients include: cardboard left in a hamster cage in the sun; acid.</p>

    <p><strong>1:35 p.m.</strong> For the first time, I heave.</p>

    <p><strong>1:40 p.m.</strong> Even if I ate 1000 sticks, TGI Friday's Endless Apps would be a bad deal, because they taste worse than eating nothing at all. TGI Friday's should pay me $10 to clear out as many of these mozzarella sticks for them as I can. TGI Friday's End This App(s).</p>

    <p><strong>1:42 p.m.</strong> Gabby catches me guzzling water like Joey Chestnut to get my hastily chewed mozzarella sticks down. "Haha!" she laughs from a couple tables away. "I'm coming to check on you!" While the water trick makes me feel like I'm about to throw up every time I swallow a bite of mozzarella stick, it does help to mask the taste. For this reason, I consider it superior to eating the mozzarella sticks normally.</p>

    <p><strong>1:45 p.m.</strong> I ask Gabby if she's had the mozzarella sticks, and what does she think of them? She tells me "They're good." Gabby and I are not yet good enough friends that we can be honest with one another.</p>

    <p><strong>1:47 p.m.</strong> By now there are people eating alone at multiple other tables. Behind me, a man in an emerald green t-shirt and matching athletic shorts sits two booths away from a woman in a black and white dress. Because they were seated facing one another, it looks as if they are dining together at a very long formal dining table.</p>

    <p><strong>2:10 p.m.</strong> Because I have the boundless self-confidence of a millennial, I believe in my heart, I can accomplish any goal. It is difficult, already, to imagine eating 1 more stick, but impossible to imagine I will not eat enough to get at least $3 from Taylor Berman.</p>

    <p><strong>2:15 p.m.</strong> Gabby walks by and catches me staring straight ahead into the distance. "How are you doing?" she asks. I laugh and tell her fine.</p>

    <p>"You're going for that week, right?"</p>

    <p>"I want to."</p>

    <p>"Do it!"</p>

    <p>"I've only been here for like three hours."</p>

    <p>"It feels like forever, right?"</p>

    <p>It does.</p>

    <p><strong>2:24 p.m.</strong> At the bathroom sink, a pretty woman in a chef's coat remarks upon the heat outside, where the rest of Sheepshead Bay is roasting just shy of 90 degrees. I tell her I've been in here a long time, so I'm actually freezing. She asks if I've been waiting a long time for my food, and offers to check on it. I tell her I'm just "eating slowly."</p>

    <p><strong>2:26 p.m.</strong> I spot my first person drinking alcohol somewhere other than the bar.</p>

    <p><strong>2:30 p.m.</strong> I turn off my phone to see if I can rely upon my internal clock to tell me when a half hour has passed.</p>

    <p><strong>2:31 p.m.?</strong> Extended fantasy sequence.</p>

    <h2>Finale: The Immortal Game</h2>
    <p><strong>1:21 a.m.</strong> I arrive home and throw up a little bit, but not as much as I expected.</p>
