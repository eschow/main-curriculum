						<p>Thank you to AAJA14 for organizing the workshop and the Washington Post for hosting and providing the wonderful food. Thank you to Code with me, co-founded by Sisi Wei and Tom Giratikanon, for open sourcing their curriculum on Github. You'll notice that this talk and these slides are very much inspired by their format.</p>

					<h2>Three things we want you to do</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Work hard</strong>. <br /><span class="notes">Coding can be challenging, and a little frustrating. But the great thing about it is, when you run into a problem, there’s always a solution, if you push yourself to find it. When something doesn’t quite work or look the way you want, that’s okay -- you can figure it out and make it better. (PRESS ENTER)</span></li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Ask questions</strong>. <br /><span class="notes">If you’re stuck, flag one of us for help. We are a small enough group where we hope we can keep everyone on the same pace. I get stuck all the time, as do my colleagues -- and often just asking a question out loud helps me find the solution. So ask questions! (PRESS ENTER)</li>
						<li  class="fragment"><strong>Have fun</strong>. <br/><span class="notes">Coding is awesome. It’s one of the most exciting ways in the world to tell your story, because, if you can imagine something, with code, you can build it. It doesn’t really take a lot of money, or special equipment, or insider access. It just takes your work. And that’s pretty awesome. So let's begin with asking the question, WHAT IS CODE?.</span></li>

					<h2>What is code?</h2>
					<div class="box-model-container">
						<p class="box-model">"Computers are good at following instructions, <br />but not at reading your mind." &mdash;Donald Knuth</p>
					</div>
					<div class="notes">
						<p>It's a way to talk to computers.</p>
						<p>Think of learning code just like learning a foreign language.</p>
						<p>First, we need to figure out what we want the computer to do for us.</p>
						<p>Then, all we have to do is figure out how to communicate that want, to the computer, in a language it understands.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section class="small">
					<h2>Code also has a few dialects</h2>
					<p class="al">Different coding languages talk to different parts of the computer, and are able to do different things, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Create programs for your personal computer, like Photoshop or Excel</li> 
						<li>Create webpages for the Internet</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="notes">
						<p>So today, you'll be learning the basics of two different coding languages that help you make webpages for the Internet. Every single thing you see on the web is shaped by code.</p>
